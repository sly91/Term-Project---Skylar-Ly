This is an introduction to my term project. My topic was to determine if High-rated ESG scores correlate with high stock performance over a period of time. To assess this, The file contained in this repostitory is my data anlysis on high-rated and low-rated portfolios and how they compare against each other. 
I would also like to mention I have conducted a regression analysis on the two portfolios to determine if there was any significant relationships with portfolio performance, and time with regard to the selection of high-rated and low-rated ESG stocks in the two portfolios.


To break it down further for simplicity:
It imports nessecary libraries needed (I explain in my paper, but for example, Yahoo finance is imported to retrieve my data for the high-rated and low-rated ESG stocks)
Downloads historical price data for high-rated and low-rated ESG stocks (from Yahoo Finance, I did not store any specfifc data in the repository as I could obtain metrics needed by downloading data from Yahoo Finance )
Calculates adjusted daily and cumulative returns for each portfolio
Plots the cumulative returns over time for comparison: This graph shows the difference between returns of each portfolio to visualize if the high-rated ESG portfolio has better performance than the low-rated ESG portfolio
Conducts a Regression analysis to examine any trends between time and performance in the two portfolio returns.
